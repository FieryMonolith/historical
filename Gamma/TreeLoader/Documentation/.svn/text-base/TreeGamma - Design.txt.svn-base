TreeGamma - Design

Overview

    TreeGamma is a program to calculate the gamma value of a phylogenetic 
tree.  The gamma value is a metric for the distance of the internode relative 
to the head and leaf nodes.  Currently, the program will be tied to Avida 
data but the algorithm should be generic enough to apply to any data assuming 
the time units work out with the underlying formulas.


Components

1. Organism - The organism component is a class meant to hold the data for an 
     Avida organism.  It is purely a data storage unit.
     
2. TreeNode - The TreeNode component is a class meant to store data that will  
     be used to construct a tree.

3. Tree - The tree will represent a phylogenetic tree.


    I am thinking now that I need to disambiguate the organism data from the 
tree in so much as the current organism data is Avida specific.  Then either 
the tree can store an interface for an organism or use templates to make that 
specification.  Then the loading of the input files can be separated into 
two distinct parts the loading of system specific information into a list 
of organisms and then the building of the tree from that list.  Then instead 
of having the tree have functions for anaylsis, make those functions 
something that works on trees.



Thoughts-

1. Access a balanced tree - O log N
   Insert a balanced tree - O log N
2. Phylogenetic trees are not necessarily balanced

Minimum required space to hold all of the organisms' data.
