    In this project I am expected to take a number of input files containing 
organism information.  For now there are only two files the historic and 
the detail.  They both contain needed organism data but the detail file 
also contains the population of organisms that are currently alive at the 
given timepoint.

X 1. Need to identify and handle duplicate ids
X 2. Be able to prune leaf nodes and their branches that only exist in the 
      historic file.
X 3. Be able to identify and remove all non-leaf organisms from the final 
     population, but leave them in the tree itself.  Basically, they should 
     not be considered leaf nodes just because they exist in the final
     population. (As per Gabe's request).  Need to think about the implication
     of this in relation to the formulas we are using.
  4. Handle the possibility of multiple tree heads?  This could potentially 
     creep up if there is a disconnect along a branch between a leaf and the
     whole tree.
