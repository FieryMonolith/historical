<h3>Summary</h3>

<h4>
<pre>
    The simple instruction set is meant to be as simple a language for 
translation directly into the construction of a creature.  The only 
way to be simpler is to list all the points, springs, properties, and
interconnections.

<h3>Command Descriptions</h3>

<h4>
<pre>
  <a name="split"></a>
  split(id, mass, x, y, z, ks, kd, fd, fs);
     unsigned int id     Each point has a unique id
     double mass         delta from original mass
     double x, y, z      vector from current location
     ks                  spring constant
     kd                  spring dampening constant
     fd                  fluctuation delta
     fs                  fluctuation start

       split creates a new point using the point that the spider is
     currently on.  The mass of the new point is the current point's
     mass, plus some delta given as a parameter.  The location of the
     new point is the location of the current point plus <x, y, z>.
     Lastly, split creates a new point relative to the current point in
     which a spring is generated between them with the specified
     spring constants.
       Once the new point is created, that point becomes the current
     point.
       If there is no current point, <x, y, z> are disregarded.

  <a name="split_dup"></a>
  split_dup(id, mass, x, y, z, ks, kd, fd, fs);
     unsigned int id     Each point has a unique id
     double mass         delta from original mass
     double x, y, z      vector from current location
     double ks           spring constant
     double kd           spring dampening constant
     double fd           fluctuation delta
     double fs           fluctuation start

       For a description, see split's description.  The only
     deviation is that not only does the new point have a spring 
     between itself and the current point.  For each spring 
     connected to the current point, a spring is created between
     the new point and the point at the other end of the spring
     using with the same spring constants.

  <a name="merge"></a>
  merge(id1, id2);
     unsigned int id1    The id for the current point to merge with
     unsigned int id2    The id for the current merged point

       The merge command takes the current point and the point
     whose id was specified and &quot;merges&quot; them together.
     The merge entails the following:
         -Add the masses together
         -All the springs connected to either point are shifted to
          the new point
         -The new point is given the specified id
       If there is no current point, or a point does exist for id
     given by id1, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="remove_point"></a>
  remove_point(id);
    unsigned int id      The id for the point to move to

      The remove point command removes the current point and then
    moves to the point specified by id.  If there is no current
    point, this command just moves to id.

  <a name="add_line"></a>
  add_line(id, ks, kd, fd, fs);
     unsigned int id     The id for point to connect the spring to
     double ks           spring constant
     double kd           spring dampening constant
     double fd           fluctuation delta
     double fs           fluctuation start

       Adds a spring between the current point and the point
     specified by the given id.  If either of those points does
     does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="remove_line"></a>
  remove_line(id);
     unsigned int id     The id for point on the other end of the
                         spring

       Removes the spring between the current point and the point 
     specified by the given id.  If either point does not exist
     then this command does nothing.

  <a name="change_mass"></a>
  change_mass(delta);
     double delta        Delta from the current value

       Changes the mass of the current point by the given delta.
     If the point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="change_ks"></a>
  change_ks(id, delta);
     unsigned int id     The id for point on the other end of the
                         spring
     double delta        Delta from the current value

       Changes the spring constant of the spring between the
     current point and the point specifed by id, by the given delta.
     If the point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="change_kd"></a>
  change_kd(id, delta);
     unsigned int id     The id for point on the other end of the
                         spring
     double delta        Delta from the current value

       Changes the dampening constant of the spring between the
     current point and the point specifed by id, by the given delta.
     If the point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="change_fluctuation_delta"></a>
  change_fluctuation_delta(id, delta);
     unsigned int id     The id for point on the other end of the
                         spring
     double delta        Delta from the current value

       Changes the fluctuation delta of the spring between the
     current point and the point specifed by id, by the given delta.
     If the point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="change_fluctuation_start"></a>
  change_fluctuation_start(id, delta);
     unsigned int id     The id for point on the other end of the
                         spring
     double delta        Delta from the current value

       Changes the fluctuation start of the spring between the
     current point and the point specifed by id, by the given delta.
     If the point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="move_to"></a>
  move_to(id);
     unsigned int id     The id for point to move to

       Moves the spider to the point specified by id.  If that
     point does not exist, then this command does nothing.

  <a name="nop"></a>
  nop();
       This command does nothing.
