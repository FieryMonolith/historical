<h3>Summary</h3>

<h4>
<pre>
    All the functions in this library pertain directly to the physics required
to simulate the creatures of WhirlingDervish.  No function has access to
outside, environment, or simulation information.  All necessary information
must be passed into each function.  The class that encapsulates these
functions holds no state information, and each function is a static class
method.  All the functions also return void, so any data that should come
out of the function should be retrieved by pointer or reference as a
parameter of the function.

<a name="CalculateFrictionalForce"></a>
static void CalculateFrictionalForce(staticMu, kineticMu, mass, force,
                                     velocity, frictionalForce)
  double staticMu, kineticMu   properties of the resistive material
  double mass                  mass of the point-mass
  const Vector3d &force        current forces acting on the point-mass
  const Vector3d &velocity     velocity of the point-mass
  Vector3d &frictionalForce    return the force calculated by this function

  Summary:
      This function calculates the frictional force a resistive material
  imparts on a point-mass, or any other shape independant objects that can
  be considered a point-mass.

  Units: meter, sec, kilogram

  Algorithm:
    weight = 9.8 * mass
    Vector3d v = < velocity[0], 0, velocity[2] >
    Vector3d f = < force[0], 0, force[2] >

    vmag = Normalize(v)
    fmag = Normalize(f)

    if(vmag == 0 && fmag == 0) {
      frictionalForce = <0, 0, 0>
    } else if(vmag == 0 && fmag < staticMu * weight) {
      frictionalForce = <-f[0], 0, -f[2]>
      frictionalForce *= fmag
    } else {
      frictionalForce = <-v[0], 0, -v[2]>
      frictionalForce *= kineticMu * weight
    }


<a name="CalculateAirResistance"></a>
static void CalculateAirResistance(drag, velocity, resistanceForce)
  double drag                 the coefficient of drag
  const Vector3d &velocity    the velocity of the point-mass
  Vector3d &resistanceForce   return the force calculated by this function

  Summary:
      This function calculates the frictional force a resistive material
  imparts on a point-mass, or any other shape independant objects that can
  be considered a point-mass.  It essentially finds the opposite direction
  of the velocity vector, then the magnitude equals drag * (||v||)^2.

  Units: meter, sec

  Algorithm:
    resistanceForce = velocity
    mag = Normalize(resistanceForce)

    resistanceForce *= -1
    resistanceForce *= mag * mag
    resistanceForce *= drag


<a name="CalculateGravitationalForce"></a>
static void CalculateGravitationalForce(mass, gravity, gravitationalForce)
  double mass                    mass of the point-mass
  const Vector3d &gravity        direction and magnitude of gravity
  Vector3d &gravitationalForce   returns the force calculated by this function

  Summary:
      This function calculates the force of gravity on a point-mass.  This
  should be changed to allow for alternate gravitational pulls.  Simply add
  a vector representing the direction and magnitude of the force.

  Units: meter, sec, kilogram

  Algorithm:
    gravitationalForce = gravity
    gravitationalForce *= mass


<a name="Verlet"></a>
static void Verlet(curPos, prevPos, force, mass, timeStep)
  Vector3d &curPos        current postion of the point-mass
  Vector3d &prevPos       previous position of the point-mass
  const Vector3d &force   current force acting on the point-mass
  double mass             mass of the point-mass
  double timeStep

  Summary:
      This is a function I found on the web.  It is supposed to be better
  than the typical movement because it doesn't store the velocity.  If you
  store the velocity, errors can compound more quickly.  So I recalculate
  the velocity by using the current and previous position.  The basic
  function for movement is
    x = x_0 + (v_0 * t) + (0.5 * a * t^2).
  However, since I am considering each timestep independantly, v_0 becomes v
  where
    v = (p - p_prev)/t
  which is delta x over delta t.  Now the function becomes
    x_new = x + ((x - x_prev) / t) * t + (0.5 * a * t^2)
  which is now
    x_new = 2*x - x_prev + (0.5 * a * t^2).
  Since, F = ma, a = F / m so the function becomes
    x_new = 2*x - x_prev + (0.5*f*(t^2))/m

  Units: meter, sec, kilogram

  Algorithm:
    temp = curPos
    curPos = (2.0 * curPos) - prevPos + ((0.5 * force * timeStep * timeStep) /
                                         mass)
    prevPos = temp


<a name="SpringForce"></a>
static void SpringForce(force0, force1, p0, prevP0, p1, prevP1,
			ks, kd, innate_length,
                        timeStep)
  Vector3d &force0, &force1     returned forces on point-mass one and two
  const Vector3d &p0, &prevP0   position and previous position of point-mass 1
  const Vector3d &p1, &prevP1   position and previous position of point-mass 2
  double ks                     spring constant
  double kd                     dampening constant
  double innate_length          rest length of the spring
  double timeStep

  Summary:
      This function calculates the force applied to the point-mass on each
  end of the spring.  The function handles the case if the current spring
  length is zero.

  Units: meter, sec

  Algorithm:
    Vector3d force = p1 - p0
    lineLength = Normalize(force)

    if(lineLength == 0) {
      Vector3d velocity = ((p1 - prevP1)/timeStep) - ((p0 - prevP0)/timeStep)
      vmag = Normalize(velocity)
      if(vmag == 0) {
        // Can't do anything, so just return
      }

      // Need direction for force
      force = velocity
    }

    force *= ks * (lineLength - innateLength)

    force0 = force
    force1 = -force
