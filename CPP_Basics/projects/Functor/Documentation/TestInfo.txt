test_all.cpp

This test program does all of the following to ensure the classes are working:
1. Goes through Functor, MemberFunctionWrapper, GenericFunctor, BinderFirst,
   Chain, OneToMany, and ReturnlessFunctor and verifyies that all 15 of
   the operator() are in working order, ie there are no typos or duplicated
   parameter passing.  To this end, each function prints out a successive
   string of characters starting with 'a' and progressively gets longer
   through 'o'.  If any of the fifteen fail or have incorrect sequential string
   of characters there is probably an error.  It does this test for both Seq
   versions, after Typelist have been verified.
   
2. Next I go through each of the functor classes mentioned above and test
   the rest of their interface.  This includes copy construction, destruction,
   cloning, assignment, comparison, accessing their interface, etc.  This
   also includes any special interface options a given functor may have but
   not the others such as OneToMany.
