There are two licenses because part of this subsystem is comprised from code
written and maintained as part of the loki-lib library.  The other code I wrote
and falls under the Boost 1.0 license.  While both licenses give essentially
the same allowances, I keep both licenses with this group and the headers
each contain their correct license information.
